## :pushpin: Installation

  Make sure your have Flutter installed on your computer. </a>. 

For help getting started with Flutter, view the<a href="https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install"> online documentation<a/>, which offers tutorials, samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

<p>Clone the repo:</p>

`git clone https://github.com/SoftRahmat/contact-list.git`



  Open with a editor, such as Android Studio or VSCode. Then you can choose how to run. 
  For example, I like to run on my own device. To do so you have to connect your device (with developer options and USB debugging enabled) on computer and check if Flutter recognizes your phone by running:

 `flutter devices`
 
  And then:
  
  `fluter run`
  
  or

 `flutter run -d YOUR_DEVICE_ID`
 
And you're done!
